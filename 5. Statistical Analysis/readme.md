# U.S.C.T. Widows Project: Statistical Analysis

## Summary
This is a collection of research output from statistical network analysis of the 2nd and 33rd regiment network data.

The [dataset] I used, after processing in OpenRefine, is also in this repository.

## Findings
When measuring and comparing actor-level betweenness centrality in each network, I found that of the top 5 actors with the highest betweenness centrality measures in network 1, the Upper South regiment, 4 out of 5 were women. In network 2 in the Lower South, only 2 of 5 actors with the highest BC value were women. The actor-level betweenness centrality for each node in the Upper South network and Lower South network are represented in Tables 1 and 2.
