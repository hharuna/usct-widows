# U.S.C.T. Widows Project: Historical Context

## The U.S.C.T. Civil War Widow and Her Veteran Husband
The U.S.C.T. stands for the United States Colored Troops. This acronym was used in the American Civil War to represent African-Americans who enlisted and served in the Union Army. Up to 210,000 African-American men served in the Union Army from all over the country.

Following the defeat of the Confederacy in 1856, the act of July 14, 1862 set up the general law pension system for war veterans of the Civil War and their dependents. African-American widows were initially excluded from this system. Protests by African-American widows at Fort Pillow, Tennessee in 1864 prompted lawmakers to address this injustice.

The supplemental Act of July 1864 accepted eyewitness testimony to support claims for pensions which allowed African-American widows to prove their marriages to veterans. This is because marriages between African-Americans were very rarely officiated and legally recognized before emancipation. 

However, the law of 1882 which used sexual morality as a basis for determining eligibility for pension undermined the rules introduced in 1864. The federal government via the Department of the Interior and Veterans’ affairs employed federal Special Examiners to investigate and report on the veracity of the widows’ claims.
