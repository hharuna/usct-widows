The 2nd regiment petitions documented are from the 2nd Infantry regiment. Most regiments are organized by strategy: artillery, cavalry and infantry. Infantry regiments are typically foot soldiers, cavalry regiments are soldiers on horseback, and artillery regiments are armed soldiers who travel with heavy artillery.

Companies are led by corporals of which there are 4 widows’ claims in this project. One widow featured was married to a sergeant, and another to a military musician.",
