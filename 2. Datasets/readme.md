# U.S.C.T. Widows Project: Datasets for RAWGraphs and Cytoscape

## Data Summary
There are three different datasets in this repository. Two of the datasets are a pair used in Cytoscapes (an edge list and a node list). Both the edge and the node list feature widows, veterans/late husbands, testifiers, and attorneys.

## Data Sources
The primary source for the data here is from [Department of the Interior, Bureau of Pensions. (1849 - 1930) and Veteransâ€™ Administration. (07/21/1930 - 03/15/1989), Case Files of Approved Pension Applications of Widows and Other Dependents of the Army and Navy Who Served Mainly in the Civil War and the War With Spain, Records of the Department of Veterans Affairs, n.d.](https://catalog.archives.gov/id/300020)

Each pension claim comprises of a mix of forms, letters and depositions. Each claim includes a Civil war widow's pension claim, her late veteran husband's pension claim (most veterans filed for pensions before they passed), and the pension or reimbursement claims of the widow's family members when the widow passes, depending on if they file for such a claim.

The key documents I focused on were the approval forms [Lucinda Ackiss' approval form](2.Datasets/George_L_Ackiss_Pension_137.jpg) and the pension forms [Lucinda Ackiss' pension form](https://github.com/hharuna/usct-widows/blob/main/2.%20Datasets/George_L_Ackiss_Pension_137.jpg).
