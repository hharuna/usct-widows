# U.S.C.T. Widows Project: Datasets for Gephi

## Data Summary
There are six different datasets in this repository. Four of the datasets are two pairs used in Gephi to create two networks based on data from the 2nd regiment and the 33rd regiment. Each pair/network has one edge list and one node list. Both the edge and the node list feature widows, veterans/late husbands, testifiers, and attorneys. 
The other two datasets are the complete datasets from the 2nd and 33rd regiments.

## Data Sources
The primary source for the data here is from [Department of the Interior, Bureau of Pensions. (1849 - 1930) and Veteransâ€™ Administration. (07/21/1930 - 03/15/1989), Case Files of Approved Pension Applications of Widows and Other Dependents of the Army and Navy Who Served Mainly in the Civil War and the War With Spain, Records of the Department of Veterans Affairs, n.d.](https://catalog.archives.gov/id/300020)

Each pension claim comprises of a mix of forms, letters and depositions. Each claim includes a Civil war widow's pension claim, her late veteran husband's pension claim (most veterans filed for pensions before they passed), and the pension or reimbursement claims of the widow's family members when the widow passes, depending on if they file for such a claim.

The key documents I focused for data collection were the approval forms, pension declaration forms and the depositions. 

The **approval forms** are written and signed by the state. The approval forms record key dates like the date of the veteran's death, the first date the widow's pension claim was filed as well as the date of approval. 

The **pension declaration forms** are written by or on behalf of the widow, as she declares her application for a pension. The declaration records the names of minor children if the widows had any, and the location her husband was enrolled among others. 

The **deposition** is written by testifiers (family relations, other veterans etc.). The relations in these depositions are categorized and defined independently in this project. These definiitons can be found in the data dictionary.

Please see below for an example of the approval form, pension declaration form and deposition respectively as they appear in the archives. ![Luncinda Ackiss approval form](https://github.com/hharuna/usct-widows/blob/main/2.%20Datasets/George_L_Ackiss_Pension_136.jpg) ![Lucinda Ackiss pension declaration forms](https://github.com/hharuna/usct-widows/blob/main/2.%20Datasets/George_L_Ackiss_Pension_137.jpg) ![Sylvia Jones deposition](https://github.com/hharuna/usct-widows/blob/main/2.%20Datasets/Paul_Jones_Pension_059.jpg).
