# Methods of U.S.C.T. Widows Project

## Limitations
Generally, this section is meant to make my research process transparent and reproducible, however much of the process developed as the project went along. Very little of the process documented here was pre-planned. That means that the process itself is subject to error. The process can be described as qualitative and subjective as it involved reading scanned handwritten documents without the aid of machine learning.
However, I have tried to maintain as much clarity as possible in my process outside of the process of reading the documents. I used OpenRefine to clean and standardize my data, RAWGraphs for primary graphs and Cytoscape and Gephi for network analysis.

## Methods Summary
The goal of this project is the investigation of the “grassroots pension networks” by the analysis and comparison of the networks using advanced network measurement metrics in order to ascertain the logics of community that held the networks together.
The project also aims to establish a project-specific intervention into data collection and design from handwritten documents by qualifying and emphasizing specific relations based on black and black feminist historical scholarship.

Therefore, the project's methods hinge on data collection practices and network analysis separately, and interdependently.

## Methods Objectives
- Collect and publish data on the grassroots pension network.
- Document the instruments and methods used in the project to support project transparency and reproducibility for scholars.
- Visualize and analyze networks and communities supporting these pension claims for the scholarly public audience.
