# U.S.C.T. Widows Project: Graphs

## Graph Summary
This is a collection of graphs created using data of locations and persons featured in widows of U.S.C.T. 2nd regiment soldiers's pension claims between 1871 and 1924. The graphs were created using RAWGraphs' online platform.

The [dataset](https://github.com/hharuna/usct-widows/blob/main/4.%20Graphs/Graph-data-1-23-25-Sheet1-csv.csv) I used, after processing in OpenRefine, is also in this repository.

## Graph Breakdown

In order to start drawing out patterns in my data, I took my general dataset to create visualizations with the RawGraphs web platform. This early dataset was the first attempt at analysing pension claims and making the argument for a "grassroots pension network."

Below are the early visualizations I made.

1. ![Alluvial graph connecting company in regiment, to widow location and attorney's office location](https://github.com/hharuna/usct-widows/blob/main/4.%20Graphs/company_widowstate_attorneystate.png) According to the Data Viz Project, an [alluvial diagram](https://datavizproject.com/data-type/alluvial-diagram/) typically represents change over time. I used the alluvial graph to compare a soldier's company with a related widow's location and their attorney's office location.
    - In  general, most of the soldiers recorded and archived as serving in the 2nd regiment had widows living in the state of Virginia.
    - Widows in Virginia, Florida, North Carolina, District of Columbia, Alabama, and Georgia  worked with attorneys in the District of Columbia.
1.  ![Beeswarm plot on correlation between age and date of widow's petition filing](https://github.com/hharuna/usct-widows/blob/main/4.%20Graphs/petition_file_vs_age.png) The Data Viz Project describes a [beeswarm plot](https://datavizproject.com/data-type/beeswarm-blot/) visualizes the distribution of a dataset. It is also possible to vary the data points' areas to show difference. I used the beeswarm plot to visualize the number of petitions filed over time. The size of the data points represents the age of the widows at the time of first filing.
    - Most petitions were filed between 1885 and 1895. The widows who filed at that time were typically younger than the widows who filed later on.
