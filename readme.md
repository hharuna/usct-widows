# U.S.C.T. Widows Project: African-American Women during Reconstruction (1860-1920)

## Project Summary
African-American women’s pension claims were for many their first interaction with the federal government as full citizens. These women who were often the sole breadwinners in their families flexed their rights as citizens with the support of a “grassroots pension network” of social ties and associational life in black neighborhoods. The network includes black professional men who were socially responsible leaders and served as claims agents alongside white attorneys in Washington, D.C. The grassroots pension network also included neighbors, veterans, acquaintances, family relations, religious leaders and former servants who testified on behalf of widows in letters, affidavits and depositions. 

This project-prototype collects data from all digitally available petitions (via the National Archives) from widows of veterans of the U.S.C.T. regiments to create graphs and networks that highlights trends and patterns in the petition process as the widows navigated them. The data collection process is ongoing. Featured at this stage of the project are 59 petitions from widows of 2nd regiment veterans who served in Companies A, B, G & I. 56 of the 59 petitions are from widows of veterans who served in Companies A & B. 

## Project Objectives
- Collect data on the widows, the bureaucratic pension process and the grassroots pension network.
- Visualize and analyze the network and communities supporting these pension claims.
- Produce graphs based on the data to read the data on a broad scale.
