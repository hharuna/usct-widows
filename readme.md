# U.S.C.T. Widows Project: African-American Women during Reconstruction (1860-1920)

## Project Summary
African-American women’s pension claims were for many their first interaction with the federal government as full citizens. These women who were often the sole breadwinners in their families flexed their rights as citizens with the support of a “grassroots pension network” of social ties and associational life in black neighborhoods. The network includes black professional men who were socially responsible leaders and served as claims agents alongside white attorneys in Washington, D.C. The grassroots pension network also included neighbors, veterans, acquaintances, family relations, and religious leaders who testified on behalf of widows in letters, affidavits and depositions. 

This project-prototype collects data from all digitally available petitions (via the National Archives) from widows of veterans of the U.S.C.T. regiments to create graphs and networks that highlights trends and patterns in the petition process as the widows navigated them. The main dataset comprises of 173 petitions from widows. The data collection process is ongoing. The data collection process is ongoing. Featured at this stage of the project are 59 petitions from widows of 2nd regiment veterans forming the first network. The second network comprises of 42 petitions from widows of 33rd regiment veterans.

## Project Objectives
- Collect data on the widows, the bureaucratic pension process and the grassroots pension network.
- Document the instruments and methods used in the project.
- Visualize and analyze networks and communities supporting these pension claims.
- Produce graphs to interpret the entire dataset on a broad scale.
